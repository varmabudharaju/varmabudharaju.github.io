As a kid, I was drawn to the beauty of mathematics, but my fascination took a new direction when I discovered computer science. It was the challenge of solving complex problems that captivated me, fueling my passion for computer science for the very same reason.

Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Gitam University](https://www.gitam.edu/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.

Immediately after my Bachelors, I spent 18 months working as a Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services for Nokia Networks, where I developed a keen expertise and interest in computer networks and distributed systems. This experience deepened my understanding of how these technologies can revolutionize the way we compute, enhancing both the safety and speed of our digital interactions.

During my master's, I expanded my horizons beyond traditional fields to explore a diverse range of domains. My journey included deep dives into computer networks and its security, cyber-physical system security, and programming remote IoT devices. Additionally, I also ventured into UI/UX development and human-computer interaction, appreciating the intricate ways technology interfaces with human needs. Emerging fields like digital health also caught my attention, recognizing their potential to significantly benefit humanity in various ways.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
