- Facial Recognition System Prototype Development: In a role focused on enhancing security measures, I designed and developed a state-of-the-art prototype for a facial recognition system. This system was capable of identifying persons of interest from live security camera feeds, enabling real-time threat analysis and response.

- The prototype was built using Python, incorporating OpenCV for sophisticated image processing capabilities. TensorFlow was utilized for executing machine learning tasks, while Numpy was employed for its efficient data handling and computational operations, ensuring the system's effectiveness even with extensive datasets.
  
- The prototype achieved an impressive 83% accuracy rate, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This milestone not only highlighted the technical proficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in enhancing security operations.


- Implemented user authentication and authorization functionalities using OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokenization for secure login and role-based access control to manage user privileges and ensure data confidentiality
